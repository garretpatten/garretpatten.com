        I grew up on the Jersey Shore in the New York City metro area. At Christian Brothers Academy in Lincroft, I took my first computer science class and learned Python. The thrill of writing code and watching it run in the terminal awakened a lasting passion for technology.

        I later attended Boston College’s Carroll School of Management, initially intent on a career in finance and business. Halfway through, however, I realized that path did not suit me. On a professor’s suggestion, I enrolled in Computer Science 1 — and fell in love with the discipline.

        The summer prior to graduation, a QA Engineering internship introduced me to professional software development. Working alongside talented engineers, I gradually gravitated toward the creative act of building rather than merely testing. That shift launched my career in software engineering and, eventually, security.

        Today I live in Georgia with my wife, daughter, and beagle. Here I continue to design and refine systems that support both work and family life. In my spare time I pursue genealogy research, play music, and read widely. Above all, I find deep satisfaction in creating elegant, reliable systems — whether for secure infrastructure or for the routines that save my family time and energy.
