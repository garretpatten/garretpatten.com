        Systems-minded security engineer with a builder's mindset and seven years of experience spanning QA, software engineering, and security. I design secure pipelines and scalable processes, drive developer enablement programs, and advocate for security as a shared organizational responsibility.

        I grew up on the Jersey Shore in the New York City metro area. At Christian Brothers Academy in Lincroft, I took my first Computer Science class and learned Python, sparking an early interest in technology. I later attended Boston College’s Carroll School of Management, where I studied Finance and Computer Science. After graduation, a QA Engineering internship introduced me to software development; I fell in love with building systems and solving problems, and I have pursued that path ever since. Today I live in Georgia with my wife, daughter, and beagle.

        In my spare time I pursue genealogy research, play guitar, and read widely. My deepest passion, though, is designing systems—whether for secure infrastructure at work or for order and clarity in everyday life. I find satisfaction in creating structures that are both robust and intuitive, a principle that shapes both my professional career and my personal pursuits.
