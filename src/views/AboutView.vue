        I grew up on the Jersey Shore in the New York City metro area. At Christian Brothers Academy in Lincroft, I took my first Computer Science class and learned Python. The thrill of writing code and watching it run in the terminal awakened a lasting passion for technology. I later attended Boston College’s Carroll School of Management, initially intent on a career in finance and business. Halfway through, however, I realized that path did not suit me. On a professor’s suggestion, I enrolled in Computer Science 1—and fell in love with the discipline.

        After graduation, a QA Engineering internship introduced me to professional software development. Working alongside talented engineers, I honed my skills in testing features and tooling, gradually gravitating toward the creative act of building rather than merely testing. That shift launched my career in software engineering and, eventually, security. Today I live in Georgia with my wife, daughter, and beagle, where I continue to design and refine systems that support both work and family life.

        In my spare time I pursue genealogy research, play acoustic guitar, and read widely. Tracing my and my wife’s family origins has deepened our sense of identity and gratitude for the present. On guitar, I most enjoy the music of Jack Johnson and John Mayer; my Martin D-42 is my favorite instrument. *Essentialism* by Greg McKeown remains one of the books that most shapes how I approach work, hobbies, and priorities. Above all, I find deep satisfaction in designing elegant, reliable systems—whether for secure infrastructure or for the routines that save my family time and energy.
